# Power & impact
A third area of inquiry we are exploring is how to measure program impact in power arenas beyond the electoral context. We are working in close partnership with the P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University to develop new research methods and metrics that help make visible durable policy agenda changes, narrative shifts, and elite network dynamics. In 2021 we will also examine which member experiences increase their own sense of agency and power.

# Electoral power

## Faith in Action | Netting more votes

This analysis shows that Faith in Action's decision to target lower propensity voters in the Nevada general election paid off. Based on their modeled scores, many of the voters with scores of less than 50 who FIA contacted (quadrant 1) were not expected to turn out (quadrant 2). After the election, an analysis of who was contacted and actually turned out showed that these voters who are almost always overlooked by other campaigns did turn out at higher rates, overperforming their expected turnout by several thousand votes.

# Shifting policy agendas

## AZ Immigrant Rights Ecosystem | State-level legislative change
<b>Decline in restrictive immigration bills over time</b>

This analysis is based on a database of all immigration-related bills passed by the Arizona state legislature between 2005 and 2018. Comparing the seven years before the immigration rights movement ousted Russell Pearce and the seven years after, the number of restrictive billsl dropped from 34 to 17. The reduction in anti-immigrant legislation was both qualitative and quantitative; this shift happened despite both chambers growing more conservative over the same period, according to the Shor-McCarty index (a measure of the ideological composition of a legislative body).

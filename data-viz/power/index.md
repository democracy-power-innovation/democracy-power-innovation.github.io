# Power & impact
A third area of inquiry we are exploring is how to measure program impact in power arenas beyond the electoral context. We are working in close partnership with the P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University to develop new research methods and metrics that help make visible durable policy agenda changes, narrative shifts, and elite network dynamics. In 2021 we will also examine which member experiences increase their own sense of agency and power.

# Electoral power

## Faith in Action | Netting more votes
<b>Nevada General Election | Net Votes Over Propensity Score Expectations</b>

This analysis shows that Faith in Action's decision to target lower propensity voters in the Nevada general election paid off. Based on their modeled scores, many of the voters with scores of less than 50 who FIA contacted (quadrant 1) were not expected to turn out (quadrant 2). After the election, an analysis of who was contacted and actually turned out showed that these voters who are almost always overlooked by other campaigns did turn out at higher rates, overperforming their expected turnout by several thousand votes.

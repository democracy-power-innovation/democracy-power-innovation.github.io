# Background
Organizing is fundamental to power-building and the health of our democracy. Unfortunately, however, there is a field-wide lack of data and analysis of most organizations' program activity—the who and the what of the work. Much of the investment in data and analytics in the last decade has focused on technology alone (not people), usually with an elections-first rather than a power-first or people-first approach.

The result is an array of alpha-tested tools for voter contact, and most of these new tools do not even consistently sync with the voter file. As a result, the organizational inputs that lead to people power remain invisible. A self-fulfilling prophecy, the invisibility of the work helps maintain the status quo. You can't invest in or systematically learn from what you can't see. Moreover, without a body of evidence that speaks to the “how” of organizing for power, we cede the narrative to traditional explanations: money, voter-targeting models, inexorable demographic shifts, and mainstream media, which stand in and take credit for major progressive victories.

The DPI Data Team and Learning Cohort launched to help fill this gap. We do regular biweekly one-to-one calls with each organization's data manager to generate ideas for analysis, and through the analysis teach the data staff how to organize data, visualize it for learning, and learn programming skills (primarily in R and Python). This team also leads a monthly call with data directors and staff from the learning cohort groups. Our long-term goal is to build a cohort of data scientists in organizing and democracy-building groups who can generate learning, analysis, and real-time strategy insights for the movement to advance our <a href="https://democracy-power-innovation.github.io/blog/2020/09/23/flip-the-formula">Flipping the Formula</a> agenda.

When we launched the learning cohort we set two broad questions of inquiry for the first year:

- Who are our people?
- What are they doing?

These are fundamental questions groups who are building power by organizing bases of people have to answer every day. <a href="/data-viz/organizing/index.html">See more here.</a>

## <a href="/data-viz/pol-landscape/index.html"> Political landscape</a>
One of our priorities was to support the organizations in co-creating questions and analyses that are most helpful to their work. We worked with a number of groups who were interested in mapping the political terraint—understanding where they had membership in relation to their political targets, where they could work to expand or turn out their base, and how the voter demographics in their state were changing over time.<a href="/data-viz/pol-landscape/index.html">See more here.</a>

## <a href="/data-viz/power/index.html"> Power & impact </a>
A third area of inquiry we are exploring is how to measure program impact in power arenas in the electoral context and beyond. We are partnering with the <a href="https://snfagora.jhu.edu/project/p3-lab/">P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University</a> to develop new research methods and metrics that help make visible durable policy agenda change, narrative shifts, and elite network shifts over time. In 2021 we will also examine which member experiences increase their own sense of agency and power.<a href="/data-viz/power/index.html">See more here.</a>

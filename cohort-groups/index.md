## Cohort groups
In 2020, we launched the DPI Learning cohort with 14 base-building groups across the United States. The cohort brings together some of the most effective organizing groups in the country—with diversity of constituency, geography and issue agenda—for shared research and learning around how to collect and analyze organizing and political data in a way that informs their overall strategy to build power for policy change.
